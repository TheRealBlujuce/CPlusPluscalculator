# Overview

I wanted to learn a bit more about C++ so I wrote a small calculator that also saves and loads previous calculations

# Future Work

If I were to continue this little project, I would probably add the following:

- 1. a way to clear out the save data of the recent calculations.
- 2. add in the specific calculation performed and not just the outcome.
